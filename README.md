# Solar Challenge Week 1 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis on Solar Radiation in Africa

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and resources used to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on solar radiation measurements in Africa, focusing on data sourced from [EnergyData.info](https://energydata.info/dataset/?q=Solar+Radiation+Measurement&vocab_regions=AFR).

## Project Objective

The primary goal is to clean, profile, and explore solar radiation datasets to identify trends, visualize patterns, and extract actionable insights that could support solar energy planning and development in Africa.
