## 📝 Summary

This report covers the tasks accomplished during Week 1 of the Solar Data Analytics Challenge. The objective was to build a reproducible analysis pipeline and explore solar datasets from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo through EDA and visualization.

### 🔧 Task Highlights

#### ✅ Task 1 – Git & Environment Setup
- Initialized Git repository: `solar-challenge-week1`
- Set up `.venv` Python virtual environment
- Configured GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Organized project structure (`notebooks/`, `src/`, `data/`, etc.)
- Documented setup steps in `README.md`

#### 📊 Task 2 – Data Profiling, Cleaning, and EDA
- Performed EDA on three datasets (`benin`, `sierra leone`, `togo`)
- Cleaned missing values using median imputation
- Identified outliers using Z-score
- Generated visualizations:
  - Time series plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Bubble charts
  - Wind roses

#### 🌍 Task 3 – Cross-Country Comparison
- Compared GHI, DNI, and DHI using boxplots and ANOVA
- Summary:
  - **Togo**: Highest average GHI
  - **Benin**: Lowest GHI variability
  - **Sierra Leone**: Most consistent irradiance

#### 🚀 Bonus – Streamlit Dashboard
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- Features:
  - Filters, sliders, and interactive charts
  - Deployed to Streamlit Cloud
